Angular is a **front-end development framework**. Front-end is all about the parts of a website that the users see. Back in the day, front-end development was mostly done using HTML and CSS. The CSS part of the code used to get very complicated by taking this approach. This very problem is solved by creating the HTML page and making it much more reactive by using Angular, so it is sometimes called as '*Reactive HTML Framework'!*

AngularJS is a [**JavaScript-based**](https://codeinstitute.net/global/blog/javascript-framework/#:~:text=In%20brief%2C%20JavaScript%20frameworks%20are,saving%20time%20for%20the%20developer.) [**Open Source**](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) framework maintained and developed by Google and its community of developers. Angular is based on JavaScript and TypeScript (which is a superset of JavaScript).

Angular is made for **SIngle-Page Applications.** It speeds up the application and has better performance than non-single-page applications.

> A single-page application is an application that does not require page reloading. For example, Gmail is a single-page application. You can test this by opening your Gmail account. After the page stops loading, we can open different sections of the mail like Inbox, Sent, Drafts etc and there will be no loading button in the left corner of the Gmail tab. **This proves that Gmail is a single-page application!**

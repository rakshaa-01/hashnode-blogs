Welcome to the seventh article in the series - **"A beginner's guide to understanding Angular"**. You can read the previous articles on this series from this [*link*](https://rakshaa.hashnode.dev/series/beginner-angular)*.*

So the next concept in Angular is **Data Binding**. But, what is data binding? Data binding is the process that establishes a communication link between the **app's UI** (template) and the **data** that it displays (the TypeScript file/ the logic of the app).

There are two types of Data Binding, namely, **String Interpolation and Property Binding.**

### #1 String Interpolation

String interpolation converts any variable to an interpolated format and it displays them on the screen. Interpolation basically binds the text with the expression value (*as we will see below*). By default, interpolation uses the double curly braces `{{` and `}}` as [delimiters](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/d/delimite.htm).

Let's see a simple example of string interpolation.

Consider an Angular component that contains a `name` variable.

```javascript
name = 'Rakshaa';
```

For displaying the name on the screen using String interpolation, we give

```xml
<h2> {{ name }} </h2>
```

Angular replaces `name` with the string value 'Rakshaa' and displays it on the screen.

Now, let's spice things up a little bit and see how to display your status <mark>(ONLINE or OFFLINE)</mark> using string interpolation!

For that, let us consider a `flag` variable that either stores **true or false**. Based on the value stored in the `flag` variable, we can display the status value as ONLINE or OFFLINE. Let,

> **flag = true** value means that you are ONLINE
> 
> **flag = false** value means that you are OFFLINE

Go to `app.component.html` file and type,

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1678365204357/a99b6930-60bd-4256-90b2-36fda88bd818.png align="center")

Go to `app.component.ts` file and declare a `flag` variable and its corresponding value (true/ false) and a function( ) to display ONLINE or OFFLINE. The output is dependent on the `flag` value.

*Note: Here, in the if statement,* ***this.flag*** *is used and simply flag is not used. This is because, since Angular is used for dynamic page applications, it must use the value pointed by the variable currently. This is ensured by the 'this' keyword.*

### #2 Property Binding

Every HTML element has some property or the other. So, let's say after a page is loaded, we want a button to be disabled for 5 seconds and then get enabled for the user to click in (*this can be useful to avoid any discrepancies in button press*).

This can be achieved with the help of a property named **"disabled"** in Angular.

First, create a button in `app.component.html`.

> &lt;button&gt; Button &lt;/button&gt;

The 5-second delay can be achieved by writing a constructor ( ) function in `app.component.ts`,

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1678368187337/4e809287-1979-417d-b5b4-4e6955a5dfec.png align="center")

```typescript
state = true;
constructor()
{
    setTimeout(() => {
      this.state = false;
    }, 5000);
}
```

The `state` variable is set to 'true' initially because the button is disabled initially. The **disabled state** is taken as the **true state**. The state variable is getting changed to false inside the setTimeout( ) function *(setTimeout( ) function is an inbuilt function in Angular)* because after 5 seconds (or) 5000 milli-seconds, the state = false.

> **enabled state = not (!) of disabled state = not of true = false**

Now, we have to **bind** this property to the constructor( ) function written above. We do property binding by placing the property within square brackets `[` and `]` and then bind it to the outcome of any variable (or) function. The variable here is `state` as declared before.

Add the below line to `app.component.html`,

```xml
<button [disabled] = "state">Button</button>
```

This will generate an output where the button is disabled for 5 seconds after the page loads. And then the button gets enabled. This can be seen here,

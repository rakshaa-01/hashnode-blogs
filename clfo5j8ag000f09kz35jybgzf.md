According to Albert Einstein, **imagination is more important than knowledge** and an idea crops up in the mind of a thinker suddenly in an intuitive way. Ideas are born in our minds and get functional by processing them through our thinking. Now comes the question, "What does thinking mean?". Thinking is defined as the process of considering or reasoning about something. Our thinking methods decide our approach to life and many things henceforth.

The idea of design thinking is based on how to approach problems in our life that crop up without our notice. Design thinking deals with problems that are difficult to decode and focuses on these problems from a solution-based perspective.

Design thinking views any problem from a human-centered viewpoint and essentially consists of five steps, namely,

* **empathize**
    
* **define**
    
* **ideate**
    
* **prototype**
    
* **test**

Design thinking is a versatile idea that has diverse applications starting from industry to education. Experts and professionals from areas like sports and games, education and research, and business and management, widely apply design thinking for effective results in their respective fields.

In this series of articles on design thinking, let us dwell deeper into the steps involved in design thinking, understand its process model and look at different case studies that help us to better relate to this idea!
